This post will show you how I progress in the subject "Mecatronica" learning new habilities and programs to do different things as 2D design:

# **L1 and L2 Learning VSCode and Github**
In this labs we learn how to used the basics comands of github to update all our content to the github repositories. Also we learn how to do that in VSCode in a graphic form. I will use the terminal to update the code because I found it more simple due to I get used to it all these years. The mor important comands are:

To clone in local the repository:

        $ git clone [url of the repository]

To know the local status of the git repository:

        $ git status

To add the new files, or the changes done in the other files:

        $ git add [files names]

To add a comment and commit the changes done:

        $ git commit -m 'comentario'

To push the changes to the online repository:

        $ git push

To pull the changes form the online repository:

        $ git pull

To merge the changes or two branches use:

        $ git merge [branches]

To create a new branch:

        $ git branch [name of the new branch]

To change between branches:

        $ git checkout [name of the branch]

To create and change to the new branch:

        $ git checkout -b [name of the new branch]

These are the basics commands I used.

# **L3, L4 and L5 Learning Inksacape Design 2D**
Fristly, I download the Inkscape program. 
Then after learning how to use the program and design some things in 2D I try to create a simple design of the Proyect we are going to create "Proyecto Mano de Zeus". 

The design is the following:
